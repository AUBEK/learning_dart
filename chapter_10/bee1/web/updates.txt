When importing the bee libraries the following warnings are given:
The imported libraries 'loading.dart' and 'overlay.dart' should not have the same name ''
The imported libraries 'loading.dart' and 'popover.dart' should not have the same name ''
The imported libraries 'loading.dart' and 'secret.dart' should not have the same name '

They probably should get differnt library names or
else be synthesized in 1 library.
The sample app runs but bee components are not showing.
